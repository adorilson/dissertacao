abstract = {The rapid proliferation and ubiquity of mobile, smart devices in the consumer market has forced the software engineering community to quickly adapt development approaches conscious of the novel capabilities of mobile applications. The combination of computing power, access to novel onboard sensors and ease of application transfer to market has made mobile devices the new computing platform for businesses and independent developers. However, the growth of this new computing platform has outpaced the software engineering work tailored to mobile application development. This position paper looks at four significant challenges to mobile application software engineering and provides a discussion of possible research directions, drawing from existing areas of software engineering, that should be further examined. Specifically, we examine the challenge of: 1) creating user interfaces accessible to differentlyabled users; 2) handling the complexity of providing applications across multiple mobile platforms; 3) designing context-aware aware applications; and, 4) specifying requirements uncertainty},

abstract = {During the recent years, themarket of mobile software appli- cations (apps) has maintained an impressive upward trajec- tory. Many small and large software development companies invest considerable resources to target available opportuni- ties. As of today, the markets for such devices feature over 850K+ apps for Android and 900K+ for iOS. Availability, cost, functionality, and usability are just some factors that determine the success or lack of success for a given app. Among the other factors, reliability is an important criteria: users easily get frustrated by repeated failures, crashes, and other bugs; hence, abandoning some apps in favor of others. This paper reports a study analyzing how the fault- and change-proneness of APIs used by 7,097 (free) Android apps relates to applications' lack of success, estimated from user ratings. Results of this study provide important insights into a crucial issue: making heavy use of fault- and change-prone APIs can negatively impact the success of these apps.},

As a sustained and established activity it represents an important opportunity for understanding everyday practices and motivations that can build up around a location-based activity. We present findings from a field study of everyday geocaching behaviour. In contrast to previous work, we take a broad perspective on the activity focussing beyond the in situ consumption of these experiences. We look too at the practices and motivations surrounding participants' creation of these experiences. Further we examine these behaviours within the social context of the on-line community that provides a significant basis for many of these behaviours. We use the findings to discuss broader implications for the design of future location-based experiences.},

@article{Liebig2010,
abstract = {Over 30 years ago, the preprocessor cpp was developed to extend the programming language C by lightweight metaprogramming capabilities. Despite its error-proneness and low abstraction level, the preprocessor is still widely used in present-day software projects to implement variable software. However, not much is known about how cpp is employed to implement variability. To address this issue, we have analyzed forty open-source software projects written in C. Specifically, we answer the following questions: How does program size influence variability? How complex are extensions made via cpp's variability mechanisms? At which level of granularity are extensions applied? Which types of extension occur? These questions revive earlier discussions on program comprehension and refactoring in the context of the preprocessor. To provide answers, we introduce several metrics measuring the variability, complexity, granularity, and types of extension applied by preprocessor directives. Based on the collected data, we suggest alternative implementation techniques. Our data set is a rich source for rethinking language design and tool support.},

@article{Medeiros2015,
abstract = {The C preprocessor has received strong criticism in academia, among others regarding separation of concerns, error proneness, and code obfuscation, but is widely used in practice. Many (mostly academic) alternatives to the preprocessor exist, but have not been adopted in practice. Since developers continue to use the preprocessor despite all criticism and research, we ask how practi- tioners perceive the C preprocessor. We performed interviews with 40 developers, used grounded theory to analyze the data, and cross-validated the results with data from a survey among 202 developers, repository mining, and results from previous studies. In particular, we investigated four research questions related to why the preprocessor is still widely used in practice, common problems, alternatives, and the impact of undisciplined annotations. Our study shows that de- velopers are aware of the criticism the C preprocessor receives, but use it nonetheless, mainly for portability and variability. Many developers indicate that they regularly face preprocessor- related problems and preprocessor-related bugs. The majority of our interviewees do not see any current C-native technologies that can entirely replace the C preprocessor. However, developers tend to mitigate problems with guidelines, even though those guidelines are not enforced consist- ently. We report the key insights gained from our study and discuss implications for practitioners and researchers on how to better use the C preprocessor to minimize its negative impact.},

abstract = {In this work, the authors describe their experience on the adoption of a model-driven product derivation tool to help variability management and automatic product instantiation of a mobile product line, called MobileMedia. MobileMedia is a software product line (SPL) that provides support to manage (create, delete, visualize, play, send) different medias (photo, music, and video) on mobile devices. It was previously implemented as a Java Micro Edition (JME) application, in two different versions: (i) the first one uses conditional compilation implementation mechanisms to modularize their respective variations; and (ii) the second one adopts aspect-oriented programming, specifically AspectJ language, to explore a better modularization and separation of their respective variations. In this chapter, the authors illustrate how GenArch, a model-driven product derivation tool developed at the authors' research labs, can be used to automatically produce the different applications of both versions of MobileMedia SPL. The chapter discusses the impact of using these two different modularization techniques (conditional compilation and aspect-oriented programming) for the product derivation process by emphasizing their benefits and drawbacks and also showing the particular model-driven techniques used to better provide their instantiation.},

abstract = {Life quality of dependent persons is associated with personal autonomy and mobility, between others parameters. But the development of mobile applications for autonomy support is a challenging activity. Some of the challenges are the diversity of target platforms (including display sizes, keypads or tactile screens variations in each platform), and the limits in memory size, processing resources, battery duration, etc. For these reasons, a software product line (SPL) approach can provide a considerable advantage in mobile application development. This article presents a SPL that makes possible the remote monitoring of dependent people to facilitate their autonomy. Wireless sensors allow real-time information such as heart rate or oxygen saturation level to be controlled. Risk situations, including fall detection, critical in elderly persons who live alone, can also be detected. In the SPL approach, only the required features are incorporated in each concrete product (avoiding the device overload with a resource-costly extensive solution). The article presents an Android/Symbian based SPL architecture, using Bluetooth wireless sensors connected to a Smartphone. The mobile system is able to detect alarm situations and is remotely connected to a central system, aimed for its use in elderly residences.},

We selected twelve popular and open-source applications available on the official Android's store for analysing. Then, we applied techniques of the reverse engineering to each target application in order to investigate three main aspects: (i) architecture of each application; use of the (ii) design patterns; and (iii) expecting handling policies. Support tools were used in order to identify dependencies between architectural components implemented in each target application, and to graphically present those dependencies. Then, based on this analysing, we present a qualitative analysis carried out on the extracted architectures. One of the outcomes consistently detected during this study was an overview of the main architectural choices that have been adopted by Android developers, resulting on formulation of a preliminary conceptual architecture for Android applications.},

For this purpose various types of information should be assembled to form a representation of the context of the device on which aforementioned applications run. To allow interoperability in an Ambient Intelligence environment, it is necessary that the context terminology is commonly understood by all participating devices. In this paper we propose an adaptable and extensible context ontology for creating context-aware computing infrastructures, ranging from small embedded devices to high-end service platforms. The ontology has been designed to solve several key challenges in Ambient Intelligence, such as application adaptation, automatic code generation and code mobility, and generation of device specific user interfaces.},

However, addressing these constraints may result in poor design choices, known as antipatterns, which may incidentally degrade software quality and performance. Thus, the automatic detection of antipatterns is an important activity that eases both maintenance and evolution tasks. Moreover, it guides developers to refactor their applications and thus, to improve their quality. While antipatterns are well-known in object-oriented applications, their study in mobile applications is still in their infancy. In this paper, we propose a tooled approach, called Paprika, to analyze Android applications and to detect object-oriented and Android-specific antipatterns from binaries of mobile apps. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a set of popular mobile apps downloaded from the Google Play Store.},

Despite the benefits of new or updated APIs, developers are often slow to adopt the new APIs. As a first step toward under- standing the impact of API evolution on software ecosystems, we conduct an in-depth case study of the co-evolution behavior of Android API and dependent applications using the version history data found in github. Our study confirms that Android is evolving fast at a rate of 115 API updates per month on average. Client adoption, how- ever, is not catching up with the pace of API evolution. About 28{\%} of API references in client applications are outdated with a median lagging time of 16 months. 22{\%} of outdated API usages eventually upgrade to use newer API versions, but the propagation time is about 14 months, much slower than the average API release interval (3 months). Fast evolving APIs are used more by clients than slow evolving APIs but the average time taken to adopt new versions is longer for fast evolving APIs. Further, API usage adaptation code is more defect prone than the one without API usage adaptation. This may indicate that developers avoid API instability.},

As of today, the market for such devices features over 850K+ apps for Android, and 19 versions of the Android API have been released in 4 years. There is evidence that Android apps are highly dependent on the underlying APIs, and APIs instability (change proneness) and fault-proneness are a threat to the success of those apps. Therefore, the goal of this research is to create an approach that helps developers of Android apps to be better prepared for Android platform updates as well as the updates from third-party libraries that can potentially (and inadvertently) impact their apps with breaking changes and bugs. Thus, we hypothesize that the proposed approach will help developers not only deal with platform and library updates opportunely, but also keep (and increase) the user base by avoiding many of these potential API ”update” bugs.},

abstract = {Design patterns offer flexible solutions to common problems in software development. Recent studies have shown that several design patterns involve crosscutting concerns. Unfortunately, object-oriented (OO) abstractions are often not able to modularize those crosscutting concerns, which in turn compromise the system reusability and maintainability. Hence, it is important verifying whether aspect-oriented approaches support improved modularization of crosscutting concerns relative to design patterns. Ideally, quantitative studies should be performed to compare OO and aspect-oriented implementations of classical patterns with respect to fundamental software engineering attributes, such as coupling and cohesion. This paper presents a quantitative study that compares Java and AspectJ solutions for the 23 Gang-of-Four patterns. We have used stringent software attributes as the assessment criteria. We have found that most aspect-oriented solutions improve separation of pattern-related concerns, although only four aspect-oriented implementations have exhibited significant reuse. This paper also discusses the scalability of the analyzed solutions with respect to separation of concerns, and the determination of a predictive model for the modularization of design patterns with aspects.},

In this paper, we present the results of our large-scale (consisting of 1, 120 open-source applications and 17.4 million lines of code) API usage analysis of Android applications. Our work is motivated by the need to mine actual Android API usage, frequent API call usage patterns and trends to understand and generate empirical data on how developers are using the mobile platform in their applications. Extracting popular and frequently-invoked methods, API packages and API call-usage patterns is useful to both the API Producers and API Consumers. For example, API Producers can view the quantitative data on API usage as a feedback from users on the relevance, usability and applicability of the respective APIs. We conduct a series of experiments on analysing the Android platform API usage (usage of different packages, usage of methods, usage across categories) and present the results of our analysis using graphs such as Bubble Chart, Radar Chart, Heat-Map for effective visualization of the results and for extraction of actionable information.},

abstract = {Android apps declare a target version of the Android run-time platform. When run on devices with more recent Android versions, apps are executed in a compatibility mode that attempts to mimic the behavior of the older target version. This design has serious security consequences. Apps that target outdated Android versions disable important security changes to the Android platform. We call the problem of apps targeting outdated Android versions the target fragmentation problem. We analyze a dataset of 1,232,696 free Android apps collected between May, 2012 and December, 2015 and show that the target fragmentation problem is a serious concern across the entire app ecosystem and has not changed considerably in several years. In total, 93{\%} of current apps target out-of-date platform versions and have a mean outdatedness of 686 days; 79{\%} of apps are already out-of-date on the day they are uploaded to the app store. Finally, we examine seven security related changes to the Android platform that are disabled in apps that target outdated platform versions and show that target fragmentation hamstrings attempts to improve the security of Android apps.},

abstract = {Android ecosystem is heavily fragmented. The numerous combinations of different device models and operating system versions make it impossible for Android app developers to exhaustively test their apps. As a result, various compatibility issues arise, causing poor user experience. However, little is known on the characteristics of such fragmentation-induced compatibility issues and no mature tools exist to help developers quickly diagnose and fix these issues. To bridge the gap, we conducted an empirical study on 191 real-world compatibility issues collected from popular open-source Android apps. Our study characterized the symptoms and root causes of compatibility issues, and disclosed that the patches of these issues exhibit common patterns. With these findings, we propose a technique named FicFinder to automatically detect compatibility issues in Android apps. FicFinder performs static code analysis based on a model that captures Android APIs as well as their associated context by which compatibility issues are triggered. FicFinder reports actionable debugging information to developers when it detects potential issues. We evaluated FicFinder with 27 large-scale open-source Android apps. The results show that FicFinder can precisely detect compatibility issues in these apps and uncover previously-unknown issues.},

abstract = {The intent of a NULL OBJECT is to encapsulate the absence of an object by providing a substitutable alternative that offers suitable default do nothing behavior. In short, a design where "nothing will come of nothing" [Shakespeare1605]. NULL OBJECT is a tactical pattern that has been discovered time and again, and not only in object-oriented systems: null file devices (/dev/null on Unix and NUL on Microsoft systems), no-op machine instructions, terminators on Ethernet cables, etc. The pattern has been documented in a variety of forms by many authors, varying widely in structure and length: from a thorough and structured GOF-like form [Woolf1998] to a brief thumbnail-like production-rule form [Henney1997]. This paper is derived from a previously published article [Henney1999] and includes the aforementioned thumbnail. The aim of the current work is to update and capture the latest understanding of the pattern and its implications, also addressing a wide audience by documenting the pattern primarily with respect to Java and UML.},

abstract="Today, when constructing software systems, many developers build their systems on top of frameworks. Eclipse is such a framework that has been in existence for over a decade. Like many other evolving software systems, the Eclipse platform has both stable and supported interfaces (``good'') and unstable, discouraged and unsupported interfaces (``bad''). In this study, we investigate Eclipse interface usage by Eclipse third-party plug-ins (ETPs) based on whether they use bad interfaces or not. The investigations, based on empirical analysis present the following observations. First, we discovered that 44 {\%} of the 512 analyzed Eclipse third-party plug-ins depend on ``bad'' interfaces and that developers continue to use ``bad'' interfaces. Second, we have observed that plug-ins that use or extend at least one ``bad'' interface are comparatively larger and use more functionality from Eclipse than those that use only ``good'' interfaces. Third, the findings show that the ETPs use a diverse set of ``bad'' interfaces. Fourth, we observed that the reason why the bad interfaces are being eliminated from the ETPs' source code is, because (ETP developers believe) these non-APIs will cause incompatibilities when a version of the ETP is ported to new Eclipse SDK release. Finally, we observed that when developers eliminate problematic ``bad'' interfaces, they either re-implement the same functionality in their own API, find equivalent SDK good interfaces, or completely delete the entities in the ETPs' source code that use the functionality from the ``bad'' interfaces.",
