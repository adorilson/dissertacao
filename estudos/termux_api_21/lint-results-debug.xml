        summary="Implied default locale in case conversion"
        explanation="Calling `String#toLowerCase()` or `#toUpperCase()` *without specifying an explicit locale* is a common source of bugs. The reason for that is that those methods will use the current locale on the user&apos;s device, and even though the code appears to work correctly when you are developing the app, it will fail in some locales. For example, in the Turkish locale, the uppercase replacement for `i` is *not* `I`.

If you want the methods to just perform ASCII replacement, for example to convert an enum name, call `String#toUpperCase(Locale.US)` instead. If you really want to use the current locale, call `String#toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault())` instead."

        summary="Using inlined constants on older versions"
        explanation="This check scans through all the Android API field references in the application and flags certain constants, such as static final integers and Strings, which were introduced in later versions. These will actually be copied into the class files rather than being referenced, which means that the value is available even when running on older devices. In some cases that&apos;s fine, and in other cases it can result in a runtime crash or incorrect behavior. It depends on the context, so consider the code carefully and device whether it&apos;s safe and can be suppressed or whether the code needs tbe guarded.

If you really want to use this API and don&apos;t need to support older devices just set the `minSdkVersion` in your `build.gradle` or `AndroidManifest.xml` files.
If your code is *deliberately* accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the `@TargetApi` annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as `@TargetApi(11)`, such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file&apos;s minimum SDK as the required API level.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly.

        summary="Icon densities validation"
        explanation="Icons will look best if a custom version is provided for each of the major screen density classes (low, medium, high, extra high). This lint check identifies icons which do not have complete coverage across the densities.

Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true`. For more information on current density usage, see http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/screens.html"

        category="Usability"
        priority="3"
        summary="Usage of `showAsAction=always`"
        explanation="Using `showAsAction=&quot;always&quot;` in menu XML, or `MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_ALWAYS` in Java code is usually a deviation from the user interface style guide.Use `ifRoom` or the corresponding `MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM` instead.

If `always` is used sparingly there are usually no problems and behavior is roughly equivalent to `ifRoom` but with preference over other `ifRoom` items. Using it more than twice in the same menu is a bad idea.

This check looks for menu XML files that contain more than two `always` actions, or some `always` actions and no `ifRoom` actions. In Java code, it looks for projects that contain references to `MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_ALWAYS` and no references to `MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM`."
